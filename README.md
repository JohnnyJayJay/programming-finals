# programming-finals

This repository contains my solutions for the 2020 winter semester 
programming finals at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

Some slight modifications have been made to make this work in a multi module project.

Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot share the problem statements. 

If you find further issues with me publishing my solutions, please message me
via `johnnyjayjay02(at)gmail.com` and I will comply and take down the material in question.
